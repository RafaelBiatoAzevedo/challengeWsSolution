# Challenge Ws Solution
  Method to sort an array of strings so that all anagrams are next to each other. Discard all strings that are not anagrams by moving them to another array, so that in the end you have two sorted arrays, one with only strings that are anagrams and the other with only strings that are not anagrams.

Example:
```
Input: ["nata", "sorvete", "anta", "paralelepipedo", "tana"]
Output:  ["anta", "nata", "tana"],
         ["paralelepipedo","sorvete"]
```
